# Epiphany Platform database connection design document

Affected version: 0.5.x

## 1. Introduction

Deploying PostgreSQL in a high-demand environment requires reliability and scalability. Even if you don't scale your infrastructure and you work only on one database node at some time you will reach connection limit. Number of connection to Postgres database is limited and is defined by `max_connection` parameter. It's possible to extend this limit, but you shouldn't do that reckless - this depends of machine resources.

## 2. Use case

Epiphany Platform delivers solution to build master - slave database nodes configuration. This means that application by default connects to master database. Database replica is updated immediately when master is modified.

## 3. Assumptions

- Database replica is read only
- Write data only to Master Node
- Select operations on replica
- There is no Pgpool-II software available for Ubuntu 18.04 - not officially supported

## 4. Design proposal

### 4.1. Minimal configuration

Minimal solution to meet with client requirements is to install Pgbouncer on database master node to maintain connection pool. This will partially solve problem with exceeded connection limits. All applications need to be reconfigure to connect not directly with database, but with Pgbouncer service which will redirect connection to database master.
This solution we can deliver fast and it's quite easy to implement.

### 4.2. High Availability configuration

Above chart presents high availability database cluster. Pgbouncer and Pgpool are located in separate pods in Kubernetes cluster. PGbouncer maintains connection pool and redirect them to pgpool which is responsible for connection pooling between master and slave node. This allows to redirect write operations to master database node and read (select) operations to slave database node(s). Additionally repmgr takes care of databases availability (must be installed on every database node), and promote subsequent slave node to be master when previous master went down.
